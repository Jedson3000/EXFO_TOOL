# EXFO_TOOL
A application for easier access to information and automation for Exfo tests. 



note this is built on Node.JS and so will need to initially use npm build and npm start. You can easily use electron to make this a dedicated webapp. 

Note: I do have a copy already as an EXE that will be available, just ask.
